# School_District_Analysis

   ## Overview
        The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and         math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic               dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for             Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the         school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
